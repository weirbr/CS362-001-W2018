Reviewing Meghan Mowery's Code from Assignment 2

Bug Number: 0001
Location:
Line 116 in Appt.java. Found by an error in ApptRandomTest.java.
Cause: 
The current check for startHour in isValid allows more appointments to be valid than there should be. Because it is checks whether the startHour is less than 0 and more than 23, that statement will never be true and allow invalid appointments to be counted as valid. 
Solution:
Change the AND statement to an OR statement. Should be if (startHour < 0 || startHour > 23) to make the appointment invalid.

Bug Number: 0002
Location: 
Line 128 in Appt.java. Found by failures in ApptRandomTest.java.
Cause:
The current if statement doesnâ€™t correctly identify valid appointments. With the current check, only appointments with a startMonth greater than 12 are counted as valid.
Solution:
Change if statement to correctly identify valid startMonths as greater than 1 and less than 12. 
If (startMonth < 1 || startMonth > 12) the appointment is invalid.
